# TOK Essay Analysis Framework

A strong TOK essay focuses on knowledge itself, not on explaining subjects.
It evaluates how knowledge is produced, justified, and limited.

## Core elements of TOK analysis
- Clear knowledge question linked to the prescribed title
- Claims supported by real-life situations
- Counterclaims that challenge assumptions
- Evaluation that compares perspectives

## Common TOK mistakes
- Describing subject content instead of analysing knowledge
- Ignoring counterclaims
- Weak or missing evaluation
- Poor connection to the prescribed title

## Why balance matters
TOK assessment rewards balance.
Strong essays explore multiple viewpoints before reaching conclusions.

Clear structure helps examiners follow reasoning without confusion.

TOK success comes from clarity of thought, not length of writing.
